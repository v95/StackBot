StackBot
========

My personal implementation of a user bot for the Stackexchange chat system.

This bot differs from the other bots that you usually see on the SE chat rooms. instead of listening for all the messages from every user, **YOU** are in complete control of the bot. The bots commands are only triggered by what you type in the chat window.

For example, the default bot invocation symbol is `$`

If I want to turn the bot off I would type:

    $off
    
By default, no plugins are supplied with the bot allowing users easy customisation of their own bots.

Any forks/plugins/bug fixes/suggestions are greatly appreciated.
